										<i class = "fas fa-quote-left"></i>
										Three weeks after Thanos used the Infinity Gauntlet to disintegrate half of all life,[N 1] Carol Danvers rescues Tony Stark and Nebula from deep space and returns them to Earth. They reunite with the remaining Avengers — Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Rocket, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and James Rhodes — and use Nebula's knowledge to find and ambush Thanos, now a crippled farmer living on an unguarded planet. They plan on retaking the Infinity Stones and using them to reverse the disintegrations, but Thanos reveals he has already destroyed them to prevent further use. An enraged Thor beheads Thanos.

Five years later, Scott Lang escapes from the quantum realm.[N 2] At the Avengers' compound, he explains to Romanoff and Rogers that he experienced only five hours while trapped, theorizing that the quantum realm could allow time travel. The three ask Stark to help them retrieve the Stones from the past to reverse Thanos' actions in the present, but Stark refuses to help out of fear of losing his daughter Morgan. After talking with his wife, Pepper Potts, Stark relents and he and Banner successfully build a time machine; Banner warns that any changes in the past will create a branched alternative reality in the past, instead of affecting the current reality's present. Banner and Rocket go to New Asgard, the Asgardian refugees' new home in Norway, to recruit Thor, now an overweight drunk despondent over his previous failure to stop Thanos.[N 1] Romanoff goes to Tokyo and recruits Clint Barton, now a ruthless vigilante following the disintegration of his family.

Banner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark travel to New York City in 2012.[N 3] Banner visits the Sanctum Sanctorum and convinces the Ancient One to give him the Time Stone. Rogers successfully retrieves the Mind Stone, but Stark and Lang's interference inadvertently allows Loki to escape with the Space Stone. Rogers and Stark decide to take a risk by time traveling further into the past. Rogers and Stark travel to S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters in 1970 where Stark encounters a young Howard Stark. They steal an earlier version of the Space Stone and more Pym Particles to return to the present.

										Neeshita Nyayapati of Times of India rated the film with three stars out of five. Praising the acting of Mahesh Babu she opined that Maharshi though a simple story but it is burdened by unnecessary commercial elements. She says, "It might not be entertaining all through, but its heart is in the right place."[15] Janani K of India Today gives two and half stars and feels that the film has meaty story but it is not to the point. She concludes, "... film is good only for Mahesh Babu fans.
